== Introduction

Bitcoin((("Bitcoin", "operational overview", id="bitcoin-operational-overview"))) is a collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem. Units of currency called bitcoin are used to store and transmit value among participants in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin users communicate with each other using the Bitcoin protocol primarily via the internet, although other transport networks can also be used. The Bitcoin protocol stack, available as open source software, can be run on a wide range of computing devices, including laptops and smartphones, making the technology easily accessible.

[TIP]
====
In this book, the ((("bitcoins", "defined")))unit of currency is called "bitcoin" with a small _b_,
and the system is called "Bitcoin," with a capital _B_.

Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything
that can be done with conventional currencies, including buying and selling
goods, sending money to people or organizations, or extending credit. Bitcoin
can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at
specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin is arguably the perfect form
of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.

Unlike traditional currencies, the bitcoin currency is entirely virtual. There are no
physical coins or even individual digital coins. The coins are implied in
transactions that transfer value from spender to receiver. Users of
Bitcoin control keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the
Bitcoin network. With these keys, they can sign transactions to unlock
the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner. Keys are often
stored in a digital wallet on each userâ€™s computer or smartphone.
Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only
prerequisite to spending bitcoin, putting the control entirely in the
hands of each user.

Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such, there is no
central server or point of control. Units of bitcoin
are created through a process((("bitcoins", "mining")))((("mining"))) called "mining," which involves repeatedly
performing a computational task that references a list of recent Bitcoin
transactions. Any participant in the Bitcoin network may operate as a
miner, using their computing devices to help secure
transactions. Every 10 minutes, on average, one Bitcoin miner can add security to
past transactions and is rewarded with both brand new
bitcoins and the fees paid by recent transactions. Essentially, Bitcoin
mining decentralizes the currency-issuance
and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any
central bank.

//-- Math for following paragraph --
//total_btc = 0
//for i in range(0, 10_000_000):
//  total_btc += (50 /  (2**int(i/210000)) )
//  if total_btc / 21e6 > 0.99:
//     print(i)
//     break
